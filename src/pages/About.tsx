            Massachusetts is that we are employee-owned. When you do business
            with us, you are directly supporting our cleaners and community.

            Mass Commercial Cleaning, Inc. is an MA-based commercial cleaning
            company founded in 1989. Our company has grown from a two-person
            start-up to over one hundred employees. In 2021, MCC transitioned to
            employee ownership after the retirement of its founders. Today, we
            are an employee-owned company where all employees receive company
            shares and participate in profit distribution.
          </p>
          <p className="history-and-about">
            We’re dedicated to ensuring that from our supply managers to our
            quality control, we’re providing our employee-owners with the right
            tools and supplies to effectively do their job. Going so far as to
            utilize a janitorial cleaning time tracking and task tracking mobile
            application, we ease communication between MCC and clients to ensure
            you’re always aware of your cleaning status.
          </p>
          <p className="history-and-about">
            Our management team has a combined 100+ years in the cleaning
            industry. Having employees who have been with us for over two
            decades is a testament to the positive environment we create for
            both our employees and our clients.
